Try to buy the best ingredients you can, as that\u2019s what really helps to make this dish amazing. I\u2019m using a flowering variety of thyme but normal thyme is fine to use. When it comes to the type of pasta, you can serve carbonara with spaghetti or linguine, but I\u2019ve been told by Italian mammas (who I don\u2019t argue with!) that penne is the original, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m using in this recipe.

    "name": "Rotolo of spinach, squash & ricotta",
    "description": "Rotolo is a really unusual pasta dish. It takes a little longer than some other pastas, but it\u2019s worth the effort because it\u2019s such a joy to eat \u2013 a real showstopper if you want to turn heads. The one thing I would advise, though, is that you practise making it the week before your party! And make sure you have a very large pan or, even better, a fish kettle in which to cook it. (This is the dish that actually got me into writing books and doing all that sort of business, as it\u2019s what I was cooking in the background of a documentary when I was spotted all those years ago, so it\u2019s pretty close to my heart!)",

    "ingredients": [
      "450 g fresh egg pasta dough",
      "Half a butternut squash",
      "olive oil",
      "1 teaspoon coriander seeds",
      "1 teaspoon fennel seeds",
      "Half a dried red chilli",
      "1 handful of fresh marjoram or oregano",
      "2 cloves of garlic",
      "800 g spinach",
      "250 g unsalted butter",
      "1 whole nutmeg for grating",
      "150 g crumbly ricotta cheese",
      "50 g Parmesan cheese plus extra for serving",
      "20 fresh sage leaves"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "First make your egg pasta dough. Preheat the oven to 220 degrees C/425 degrees F/gas 7.",
      "Halve, deseed and chop the butternut squash into big chunks and rub them with a little olive oil.",
      "Bash up the coriander seeds, fennel seeds and chilli in a pestle and mortar with a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper.",
      "Dust this mix over your pieces of squash, then put them into a snug-fitting ovenproof dish or roasting tray, covered with a dampened piece of greaseproof paper.",
      "Pop the tray into the oven for about 30 minutes, then remove the paper and let the squash roast for another 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden.",
      "While this is cooking, pick the marjoram or oregano leaves, discarding the stalks, and peel and finely slice the garlic.",
      "Get a large pan nice and hot and add a little olive oil, the herb leaves and sliced garlic. Move it all around for 20 seconds, then add the spinach.",
      "Water will cook out of it as it heats up - this is fine, though, as we will cook it away. Using a pair of tongs, keep the spinach moving quickly around the pan, then after a minute add a couple of knobs of butter and a good grating of nutmeg and stir it around a bit more. Keep cooking until the moisture has cooked away then season to taste and allow to cool.",
      "To roll out your pasta either use a pasta machine to give you 4 or 5 long sheets (15cm x 30cm wide) and stick them together using a little water, or you can do what I do and use a rolling pin on a large surface, dusting with flour on top of and underneath the dough. Have a go at both ways.",
      "Keep it in a rectangular shape but trim it as necessary. Roll out to the thickness of a beer mat and the size of a tea towel, then lay it out on top of a clean tea towel.",
      "Once you've done this, spoon a line of squash along the long edge of the sheet nearest you.",
      "Sprinkle the spinach over the rest of the sheet, leaving the top 5cm of the pasta sheet clear.",
      "Crumble the ricotta over the spinach, finely grate over the Parmesan and you're ready to begin rolling!",
      "Brush the last clear edge of the pasta sheet with a little water then, working carefully, use the nearest edge of the tea towel to roll the pasta up and away from you, like a Swiss roll.",
      "Roll the rotolo up in the tea towel and tie it firmly at each end using some string. You can secure the sausage shape even further by tying some more round the middle if you want. Tie a little extra string at one end so it can hang out of the cooking pot and act as a handle.",
      "Now, to cook the rotolo, get your fish kettle or very large pan with a lid and fill it with boiling salted water.",
      "Lower the rotolo in and use the fish kettle rack on top to keep it submerged. If using a saucepan, hold the rotolo down with a plate. Simmer for about 25 minutes.",
      "While it's cooking, you need to clarify some butter. To do this, take the remaining butter and place it in an ovenproof dish in the oven on a low plate-warming temperature (80 degrees C). Over the next 10 to 15 minutes it will melt and you'll see that the milky whey will sink to the bottom.",
      "Discard any white bits floating on the top, then spoon out the clear golden butter and put to one side. Discard the whey. You won't need all the butter now, but it's quite hard to clarify any less than this - you can leave the extra in the fridge to use for your roast potatoes another day.",
      "Now you've removed the whey from the butter, you can heat it up more aggressively. So put about 3 tablespoons of your clarified butter into a pan and heat it up. Test to see if the butter is hot enough by adding a sage leaf to it. If it fries nicely, add the rest of the leaves and fry for about 30 seconds until they begin to crisp up. Then remove from the heat and put to one side.",
      "When the rotolo is ready, carefully remove it from the pan, take the string off, unroll it and slice it up - a couple of slices per portion.",
      "Scatter a few sage leaves over the top, drizzle with a little of your sage-flavoured butter, and finish off with a grating of Parmesan. Unbelievable!"

      "GET AHEAD For the stuffing, put a high-sided roasting tray (25cm x 30cm) on a medium-high heat with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Squeeze the sausagemeat out of the skins straight into the pan, breaking it up with the back of a spoon. Let the sausage start to crisp up, stirring occasionally, then tear in the sage leaves. Trim the fennel, peel the onions, then roughly chop both, add to the tray, and cook on a medium heat for 20 minutes, or until soft and caramelized, stirring occasionally. Pour in the wine and let it completely cook away, then season to perfection, tasting and tweaking. Chop the bread into 2cm chunks and stir in, then turn the heat off and leave to cool completely.",
      "Lay out the lamb on a clean work surface. Scrunch and spread the cold stuffing all over the meat, then roll it up, sealing the filling inside (if any falls out, just poke it back in at the ends once tied up). Cut yourself eight 60cm lengths of string, slide them underneath the lamb at regular intervals, then tie them up at the top. Wipe out the tray, chuck in the lamb bones, break apart and add the unpeeled garlic bulb, then sit the lamb on top. Cover and refrigerate overnight.",
      "ON THE DAY Preheat the oven to full whack (240\u00b0C/475\u00b0F/gas 9). Get the lamb tray out of the fridge, rub the meat with a little olive oil, place in the oven, and turn the temperature down to 150\u00baC. Roast for 4 hours, or until tender, basting every hour with the tray juices and adding a splash of water each time. Remove from the oven and transfer the lamb to a serving platter. Cover with tin foil and a clean tea towel, and leave to rest for 1 hour. Use a spoon to skim the fat off the tray of bones (save it in a jar for tasty cooking another day). Put the tray over a medium heat on the hob and stir in the flour, jam and a swig of red wine vinegar, scraping up all the sticky bits from the base of the tray. Cook for a couple of minutes, then pour in 1.2 litres of water. Let it simmer on a low heat to the consistency of your liking, stirring occasionally. Pass the gravy through a sieve into a pan and season to perfection, tasting and tweaking. Simmer on the lowest heat until needed.",
      "TO SERVE Uncover the lamb, spooning any resting juices into the gravy. Cut away the string. Take it to the table, ready to carve in front of your guests."

      "600 g potatoes",
      "3 large carrots",
      "\u00bd teaspoon Dijon mustard",
      "\u00bd a lemon",
      "extra virgin olive oil",
      "olive oil",
      "100 g frozen peas",
      "100 g baby spinach",
      "4 large free-range eggs",

    "steps": [
      "Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0C/350\u00b0F/gas 4.",
      "Peel the potatoes and carrots, then coarsely grate them in a food processor or by hand on a box grater. Add a good pinch of sea salt, toss and scrunch it all together, then leave for 5 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, mix the mustard, a good squeeze of lemon juice, and a couple of lugs of extra virgin olive oil with a little pinch of salt and black pepper in a medium bowl and put aside.",
      "Drizzle a really good lug of olive oil into a large bowl and add a good pinch of pepper. Handful by handful, squeeze the potato and carrot mixture to get rid of the excess salty liquid, then sprinkle into the bowl.",
      "Toss in the oil and pepper until well mixed, then evenly scatter it over a large oiled baking tray (roughly 30cm x 40cm). Roast for around 35 minutes, or until golden on top and super-crispy around the edges.",
      "Meanwhile, blanch the peas for a minute in a large pan of boiling salted water, then scoop out, add to the bowl of dressing and pile the spinach on top.",
      "Just before your r\u00f6sti is ready, with the water gently simmering, crack in the eggs, poach to your liking, then carefully remove with a slotted spoon.",
      "Serve the r\u00f6sti with the eggs on top. Quickly toss the salad together to dress it and scatter in piles on the r\u00f6sti, then crumble over the feta and serve. I like to whack it in the middle of the table and let everyone dig in."
